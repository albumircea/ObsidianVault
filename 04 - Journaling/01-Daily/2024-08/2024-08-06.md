# Trading
## London 
### Trade 1
#### Summary
After sweeping significant Daily BSLQ, expectation was for a Daily/4H pullback to start. 

Coming into the session, the M15 Swing was still bullish so I wanted to see if the **M15 Internal OF would switch bullish first** before considering quick longs. 

However, M15 OF remained bearish and eventually formed a bearish M15 BOS to start the HTF pullback. 

There was a **Phase A2** (pro MTF Swing + pro MTF Internal after the MTF BOS) shorting opportunity towards the end of the session.

**Generally**, I'm not a fan of these trades as you are relying on momentum sustaining. I waited for a clear M1 LC-2A to get enough R:R to target the recent M15 low (as I don't want to have to target far when a deeper M15 pullback can form). 

**Frustratingly**, I hesitated taking the trade as it formed at the end of the session, but it plated out nicely. I'm a little rusty getting back into things after a couple weeks of the charts. 

There was also an M5 LC-1. 
Expectation is for price to target the SSLQ at Monday's low.
