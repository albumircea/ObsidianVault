## London 
### Trade 1
#### Summary
- I didn't have a massively clear bias coming into session. When this is the case, I wait to see how price develops when the volume kicks in.
- M15 swing was bullish. However, the range was poorly formed with EQL's behind which suggested it was very possible that price was going to run the lows.
- At session open, we had a strong liquidation on the M15 followed by a PBL flip and bearish M15 CHoCH with clear bearish momentum.
- This was a pretty clear signal from the market that price was going to push lower so I was happy to follow the bearish OF until something changed. Unfortunately there was no entry but the lows were eventually run.
- There were a couple of valid buy entries but while the M15 was technically bullish, rarely is it a good idea to trade against that sort of bearish momentum, particularly when the intentions were not that clear overall.

## New-York
### Trade 1
#### Summary

- Following the BOS this morning it was possible we would see a pullback.
- We had an M15 CHoCH but ideally I wanted to see demand hold before looking for buys as they were phase D and we had a lot of bearish momentum overall so I was conscious that the first CHoCH could be a LQ grab before pushing lower.
- Demand held and we got a nice strong bullish close on the M15 at which point I was interested in buys. I contemplated placing the M15 RE but it was close to news so I knew there was little chance of it playing out beforehand so I decided to pass and get on with some other work.
