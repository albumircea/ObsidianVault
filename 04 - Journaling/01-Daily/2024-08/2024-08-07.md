# Trading
## London 
### Trade 1
#### Summary
I took the M15 RE long and stopped for BE. 

There were additional opportunities on the M5/M1 which I didn't take. 

My bias was short at the start of the session as it appeared the M15 Swing pullback was finished and ready to target the weak low. 

There were no HP supply zones, so as mentioned in the pre-session analysis, I was waiting for a sweep zone to form during session before considering shorts. 

At London open, M15 OF switched bullish so I took an M15 RE long to target the Asia high BSLQ. 

Unfortunately for me, it looks like the M15 supply zone at the Asia is holding and price is currently ranging between weak structure on both sides. 

I will post a video recap later today for both today's and yesterday's sessions.
