## London 
### Trade 1
#### Summary
Pre-session the immediate M15 PA wasn't showing anything clear with no HP POIs.

At FF open, price formed a strong fractal bullish shift from M15 demand, after sweeping M15 LID, and created a fresh M15 demand zone.

I took a 0.618 buy limit long from this POI.

The idea was to play the next bullish M15 Small Internal leg. This is on the more aggressive side as counter M15 Large Internal targeting the premium of the range.

You can view it as a CE from the initial M15 POI, or a refined M15 RE of the new M15 POI that formed.

Don't get too caught up in definitions. Just focus on the general idea of following the bullish OF.

I got 'lucky' as my limit order was hit to the micropip, but 'unlucky' with my TP being missed by 0.4 pips.

Very fine margins in trading between me being up +6R from the last two LDN sessions, compared to now being at breakeven. Fun times.
