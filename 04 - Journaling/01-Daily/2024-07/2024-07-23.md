## London 
### Trade 1
#### Summary
Flip Supply LC-1 There was logic to take the LC-1 in my opinion, but with the overall rangebound PA, wicks coming back and size of the M5 EM candle I was happy to wait. Not enough LQ taken during session for me to hit the RE with better RR.

Logic for the LC-1 though: Was the Supply to hold, nice retracement on the M5 LC-1 candle itself confirming the POI may be holding, session timing (right at LDN open where volume is at its highest), swept BSLQ during Asia and began to form strong Bearish M15 OF, all these lows to the left from yesterday could have been seen as weak where they failed to cause another Bullish i-BOS, flip.
