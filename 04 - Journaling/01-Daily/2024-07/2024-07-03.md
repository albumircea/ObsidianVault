## London 
### Trade 1

#### Summary

- Nothing for me.

- The session bias was long in line with the bullish 4H OF and bullish M15 Internal structure.

- Price had mitigated the extreme M15 Internal demand at session open but did not form a LTF strong liquidation.

- There was an M1 DCE long here but the main risk is getting stopped out if the strong liquidation forms.

- There were aggressive scalping opportunities at the end of the session.

- But they are not how I typically trade as the M15 Internal pullback can start at any moment.

- R:R is not favourable. No clear immediate LQ to target. 4H BSLQ is too far away.

- It's higher probability to take these style of positions (pro MTF trend momentum plays) where there is a clear MTF LQ target nearby, such as the weak M15 high/low [but that's already been taken in this scenario].

Pair aggressive trading with aggressive management
- trailing to BE
- trailing higher lows
- quick targets

Focus on:
- the initial mitigations of HP M15 POIs
- pro MTF OF
- trading in line with 4H bias
