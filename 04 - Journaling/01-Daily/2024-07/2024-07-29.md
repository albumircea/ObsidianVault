- Coming into session the price action was not the cleanest with price stuck in a messy range. Given the corrective nature of the reaction to 4H demand it was pretty clear that the next impulsive leg was going to be to the downside so if anything sells were the higher probability play.

- When things are not clear, the best way to approach the markets is to wait for the M15 order flow to kick in during session and then trade in line with this, provided it makes sense relative to the overall structure of course.

- Would consider sells following order flow, but no M5 LC-1s set up. If one of these Supply zones had taken liquidity on the M15 I'd be confident enough to hit it with an RE.

- Today we saw very clear bearish order flow forming during session so the obvious play was to trade in line with this as we knew that the next 4H leg was likely to be to the downside.

- There was a potential LC1 on the M5, and a very clean LQEM2A/CE on the M1.
