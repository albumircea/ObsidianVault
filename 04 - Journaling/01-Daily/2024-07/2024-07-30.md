## London 
### Trade 1
#### Summary
EU is looking clean this morning.

Two potential scenarios:

-> M15 swing and internal are bearish so Phase A sells are high probability. Very clear supply at the extreme of the internal range and the EQ of the swing range. 

-> Coming off a 4H liquidation and in the discount of the swing range, so can potentially look for Phase D buys to play the next leg of the internal pullback into supply.

## New-York
### Trade 1

#### Summary

**HP SELL OPPORTUNITY**

Price had mitigated the high probability M15 supply so sells were the main focus coming into session. M15 demand was holding so I wanted to see a bearish M15 CHoCH to signal that price was ready to continue lower.

We got the bearish M15 CHoCH at which point sells were super high probability. There was an M5 flip zone formed through strong liquidation where I placed an order, but unfortunately it was not tagged.

Price then sold off aggressively as anticipated but unfortunately did not pull back to any M15 supply before running the weak low.
