## Questions

What Is the Objective?
 - HTF Objective / Narrative
 - MTF Objective / Narrative
- Watch out if the objective has already been completed before I want to hop in !?     

Where is the liquidity? Who is induced?
 - Available LQ?
 - Sweeps
 - Inducement
 - Traps

Who is in control (Supply/Demand)
 - Is S/D holding
 - Is S/D failing

Am I trading PRO Strong Structucre && COUNTER Weak Structure?
 - Where is Strong structure
 - Where is Weak structure
 - Has the objective been fulfilled (done it's job) ?
