**Metamask is a hot (software) wallet used to interact with the EVM compatible blockchains like Ethereum, Avalanche, or Fantom.**


The ONLY time you have to use your seed phrase is when you login to Metamask through the MM interface. Never ever type your seed phrase anywhere else. If you accidentally do that and expose your account will be exposed. This means all the addresses with that account will be exposed too.


Within one account (one [[Metamask]] instance with one seed phrase) you can create many addresses. In the UI it's called account which is a bit confusing. Create a few to spread risk. If you sign some malicious transactions then you will only lose your money that's under that address. The rest of your addresses within that account should be safe as long as you don't give out your seed phrase.


A [[Remote Procedure Call]] (RPC) node is a computer server that allows users to read data on the blockchain and send transactions to different networks.
- dApps need to communicate with **blockchains** to access info and make transactions. 
- This connection is facilitated by what is known as RPC nodes. Add/switch networks in the settings. 

Why would you switch RPC's? Sometimes the nodes go down or get congested, so you have to switch to another one to execute your transactions. Some of the nodes also have privacy issues.
