A crypto exchange is a platform that allows users to buy and sell their cryptocurrencies.
[[Centralized Exchanges]] own your private key and usually hide the complexity as they are mostly very matured products. They are usually easier to use than decentralized exchanges. They can be also used for on-ramp/off-ramp fiat money. 
[[Decentralized Exchanges]] don't have access to your private key and you don't hold any money on them, so they are more secure. The UI/UX is more complex though and you have to learn very well how to use them.
