## How to get started with your Ledger

1. Once you have it delivered make sure you factory reset the device before using it. 
2. After thatyou will have to create an accountwith a new seed phrase. 
3. Make sure you securely store it. As a last step you will have to install the Ethereum App software. This is the only one you should install and you will see soon why.

## What happens if you lose your Ledger

Nothing happens as your Ledger doesn't store any coins. It's just an access method to your accounts.
==If you lose your Ledger then you can just get another one and restore your account with the seed phrase.==
As long as your seed phrase is not exposed you should be fine.


## Using Ledger with [[Metamask]] 

- If the Ethereum App is installed on your Ledger then you can connect it to Metamask by clicking on Connect hardware wallet in your Metamask account. 
- The reason you don't have to install other EVM compatible chain apps on your Ledger is that you can easily switch between networks with the help of Metamask.
- If you wanna use a non-EVM compatible chain like Solana then you will have to install other apps as well. Once you connected your Ledger to Metamask you can do all the interaction through Metamask. 
- Everything will be the same like when you use Metamask only except once you trigger a transaction you will have to sign it with your Ledger.

  
## Using Ledger as a vault

If you use one of your Ledgers as a vault, then don't connect it to any dApps. In this case vault means your high value, long term holdings including coins and NFT's

You can connect your Ledger to Metamask BUT don't connect it to Uniswap, Opensea, or any other applications.
