A wallet acts as an interface to access this address and manage your cryptocurrency. A crypto wallet is a device, a program, or a service which stores the public and/or private keys that give you access to your cryptocurrencies.


You should always check which one is the best wallet for a particular chain. Usually your wallets will be browser extensions. Besides Solana chain ([[Phantom]] wallet), usually you will use Ethereum and other EVM compatible chains (Base, Arbitrum, etc), so you will use [[Metamask]]. There are other options that have better privacy but only [[Metamask]] is integrated with most of the dApps.\

___

- Protect your seed phrase. If someone gets access to your private key then your money will be gone. You shoould only ever type it in the wallet interface.
- As your crypto portfolio grows have several accounts with several addresses and split up your money among them. If one of your accounts/addresses gets exposed then you will only lose a small portion of your portfolio
- If you have at least a few thousand in crypto then use hardware wallet for extra safety. Hardware wallets won't protect you from everything though.
- Have separate wallets (burner wallet) with little money to interact with protocols. Only authorize applications that look safe.

**<font color="#92cddc">On-ramp</font>** means that you buy crypto with fiat money. 
**<font color="#92cddc">Off-ramp</font>** means that you sell crypto for fiat money.




 On-ramp/Off-ramp means that you buy crypto with fiat money - Some coins are only liquid enough or available to trade on exchanges. In this case send your coins to the exchange, then make the trade on the exchange, then send your coins back to your on-chain address. - Day trading. In this case you should only keep as little money as you need for trading.

# **Seed Phrase**

There are several ways to store your seed phrase. You have to make sure no one can get access to it besides you and you shouldn’t lose it either. 

	What I do personally is to save it in a text file then encode it (AES 256-Bit Encryption for instance) and keep it on a USB stick or cloud storage. 

This is so that if someone compromises the file, it’s still encrypted and protected by a strong password. Some people like to write it down on a piece of paper. I personally don't like that approach as it could get damaged or lost.




## **Transaction Fees**

#### **Add money to the address to execute transactions**

-> To be able to execute transactions you will have to send chain native coins to pay gas. 
-> You have to send them from some other addresses or exchanges. You need $ETH in your wallet on Ethereum network to be able to execute transactions. 
-> On other chains it can be other tokens: $FTM -> Fantom network, $ETH -> Arbitrum network.
